# Python Practice Repository: Arrays, Maths, Equations, and Placement Questions

This repository serves as a collection of Python programs that focus on fundamental array operations, mathematical calculations, solving equations, and typical coding problems frequently asked in placement exams. It is designed to help learners and developers practice and enhance their programming skills in Python, especially for coding interviews and technical placements.

## Arrays

The array section contains various programs demonstrating basic operations such as searching, sorting, and matrix manipulations. Youâ€™ll find implementations of common algorithms like binary search, bubble sort, and operations like matrix addition or transposition. These programs are crucial for understanding how data is structured and manipulated efficiently in Python.

## Mathematics

The mathematics section includes solutions to common problems such as finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, and identifying prime numbers. These fundamental math programs build a foundation for solving more complex mathematical and algorithmic challenges.

## Equations

This section focuses on solving different types of mathematical equations, including linear and quadratic equations. It also provides solutions for systems of equations. These programs are useful for learners who want to apply Python to solve algebraic problems or perform symbolic mathematics.

## Placement Practice

The placement practice section contains a set of coding problems that are commonly encountered during technical interviews and placement exams. These problems cover a variety of topics such as string manipulation, data structures, dynamic programming, and bit manipulation. Practicing these problems will prepare individuals for tackling coding challenges under timed conditions.

This repository is structured to be a practical resource, providing both the theory and implementation of common coding concepts and algorithms that are essential for anyone preparing for coding interviews or improving their Python skills.
